1. Enroll an admin identity. [Link to instructions](/reference/40-command-line/login.mdx)
1. Unwrap the JSON file to obtain the certificate and private key.

    ```text
    ziti ops unwrap admin2.json
    ```

1. Compose a keystore from the certificate and private key. The `-legacy` flag is necessary when importing the keystore into some versions of macOS Keychain Access.

    ```text
    openssl pkcs12 -export -in admin2.cert -inkey admin2.key -out admin2.p12 -name "admin2" -legacy -password 'pass:mypassword'
    ```

1. Import the keystore:

    * macOS: Import into System Keychain via Keychain Access application for Google Chrome. You can run a terminal command or double-click the keystore file or drag it onto the login keychain to import it.

        ```text
        security import admin2.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain -T /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app -P 'mypass'
        ```

    * Windows: Import into the Windows Certificate Store (Personal store) via certmgr.msc.
    * Linux: Import into your browser's certificate store or system certificate store (e.g., Chrome Settings > Privacy and Security > Security > Manage certificates).

1. Visit the console in your web browser. The browser will prompt with a list of imported client certificates. Select the one you imported in the previous step.

1. Press the "LOGIN" button without entering a password.
